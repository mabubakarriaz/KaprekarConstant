# KaprekarConstant
Kaprekar constant, or 6174, is a constant that arises when we take a 4-digit integer, form the largest and smallest numbers from its digits, and then subtract these two numbers. Continuing with this process of forming and subtracting, we will always arrive at the number 6174

For instance: 
Take a 4-digit number like 3215. Rearranging to form the largest and smallest with these digits, we get 5321 and1235. Now, subtract them: 5321-1235 = 4086. Continue with the process of rearranging and subtracting:

| Descending - Acending | Answer |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| 8640−0468 | =8172 |
| 8721−1278 | =7443 |
| 7443−3447 | =3996 |
| 9963−3699 | =6264 |
| 6642−2466 | =4176 |
| 7641−1467 | =6174 |
